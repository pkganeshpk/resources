### List of things to do after layoff 

This is just the procedural list that doesn't address the emotional fallout of the layoff :-(

### For visa holders in the US
* How much time do you have to job search before departing US? 
   * H1B = 2 months max, F1 OPT = 4 months max)
* If you're short on time, can you negotiate with your ex-employer about placing you on garden (unpaid) leave instead of letting you go? 
    * They're required to notify UCSIS directly on the day of layoff. So this may be unlikely - but worth trying. Every day added pushes your departure date and gives you prep time!
* If on F1 OPT, please consider doing voluntary work to fulfil visa terms.

#### For future reference 
* File your Permanent Residency (EB2/EB1) as soon as you can at your next firm.

### Medical Coverage
* Ask employer about medical insurance coverage, and Cobra coverage therafter.
